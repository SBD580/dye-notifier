## Dynamic Yield Exercise - Notifier

This part should be running in a scheduled manner. It will check for the last time the cat has been fed and if the threshold has passed (15 minutes) without the cat being fed it will notify (SNS) about it.
Only when notification will be triggered until the cat will eat again.
